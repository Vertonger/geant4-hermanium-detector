# geant4-hermanium-detector 
The efficiency of semiconductor germanium detectors varies depending on the energy of the gamma rays. Using the Geant4 library, a semiconductor detector was modeled to build an efficiency curve.

The scheme of HPGe-detector (vertical and horizontal  incision): 1 – crystall of hyperpure germanium, 2 – non-active layer, 3 – the contact layer made of bore, 4 - aluminum bracket wall,5 - aluminum wall of the detector cover
